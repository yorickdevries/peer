                            <h3>Student</h3>
                            For a student we collect the following data:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The courses and assignments that you are enrolled in</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h3>TA</h3>
                            For a TA (teaching assistent), we collect the following data:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The comments given by a TA</li>
                                <li>The time that the comment was given</li>

                            <h2>How do we collect your data</h2>
                            <p>
                                Almost all data we collect is collected when using Peer. We collect this data when you
                                perform an action in the system where it can be reasonably expected that the result
                                needs to be stored. For example:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Uploading files</li>
                                <li>Entering responses</li>
                                <li>Enrolling for a course or assignment</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>How will we use your data</h2>
                            <p>
                                At this moment, we only use the data given to support the functionality Peer promises,
                                giving students an easy way to ask questions and sign off work and giving teaching staff
                                an easy to use system to support signing off and answering questions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the future, this data might be used for research purposes. This research would be
                                done to explore the possibilities of increasing efficiency and quality of the support
                                given to students and teachers. When that happens and if this falls within your rights,
                                you will be able to opt out of this.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To comply with GDPR regulations, all data is stored on site at the TU Delft. Currently,
                                the data stored has no expiration date (date where it will be deleted).
                            </p>

                            <h3>The right to erasure</h3>
                            As there is no precedent for a request for deletion of the data, there is no clear answer to
                            what happens when this is requested. As some data might be used to determine a grade, this
                            might either:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    not be allowed, as we need this data to fulfill your request to be a student and
                                    gave us permission to do so
                                </li>
                                <li>be allowed, but will result in failing the corresponding course</li>
                                <li>
                                    be allowed, but will forfeit your ability to dispute the grade for the course you
                                    followed
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                There is a current investigation into this question and once this has concluded, the
                                privacy statement will be updated to reflect the conclusions.
