## Reviewing someone else's assignment
After switching to the `Review` tab, it is possible to annotate the submission (which the submitter will be able to see once they get their reviews back):

If a submission questionnaire was made by the teacher, this should be visible below the submission, where you can fill out the form and click `Save all unsaved answers` to save answers before clicking `Submit Review`:
