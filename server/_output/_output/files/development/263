Hmm it aint gastronomy but if you want a cheap ass meal, super fast, which is also bussing, 
buy some wraps, some canned beans, some tomato/pasta sauce, a small veggie mix, 
you stir the veggies in the pan with the tomato sauce, the beans, spice all that up and 
just serve it with the wraps, takes 1dasd0min max and its good
