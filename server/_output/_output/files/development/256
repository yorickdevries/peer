# Paper 1
- **Title**: Early assessment of perceived customer value: acase study comparing a low-and high-fidelity prototype in dentistry
- **Research Question**: How does prototype fidelity affect in assessing perceived customer value?
- **Methodology**: Looked at a case study involving dentistry. Randomly showed a
  high or low fidelity prototype to patients and experts and then performed a
  thematic analysis
- **Result**: No statistical difference in assessing perceived customer value between high and low fidelity prototypes
- **Conclusion**: Reiterated the result but also talked about the limitations (only certain groups were sampled, perhaps leading to sampling bias)

# Paper 3
- **Title**: Why measuring individual innovativenessis so difficult: a critical review of standardmethods and new ideas to measure innovativeness
- **Research Question**: Why are standard metrics to measure individual innovativeness insufficient and can they be improved with alternative approaches such as using bibliographical information?
- **Methodology**: Compares standard IIS metric to the new metric called the "New Scale". Also compares and attempts to find correlations betweedn innovativeness between IIS and bibliographical information.
- **Result**: Single self report question contains almost the same amount of information as the standard IIS scale, supporting the hypothesis.
- **Conclusion**: Reiteration of results and how it supports the hypothesis and how it could be extended (measuring brain activity in response to externals stimuli)
