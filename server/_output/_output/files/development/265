Hi, I'm Lohith. My major is CSE at EEMCS. I chose this minor because I like choosing what I want to
focus on and also enjoy having ownership of my own ideas. Ever since I was young, I enjoyed the thrill
of someone else finding value in something that you built. I think that I'm particularly good at managing
resources, especcially when the resources available are scarce. This couples nicely with my other strength
which is establishing a clear but flexible action plan once a goal is there. I love leearning about new technologies
and how they are being used to provide value to people. Regarding my personal side, I enjoy playing 
ultimate frisbee and badminton. My number in the profile card is Engineer 8
