Questions
- What are you currently researching
- can it see things dissolved in liquids. 
- what is the range/depth of it
- we heard from a researcher a cm under the skin. 
- can we then see the contents of the blood. 
- how far can it work, how much air between
- How expensive are multispectral cameras (compared to visible range cameras)
- How effective is using hyperspectral imaging from cameras (can it detect localized pollution?)
- any questions for us


tissue border identification (to remove the whole tumour)
- determining factor - (wavelength)
- penetration depth wavelength steve jacques/brian pogue
- optical windows for tissue(uv shortwave infrared)
- some wavelength that glucose absorbs light (def light)
- Limitations: - penetration depth/accuracy/ 
	-concetrations of melanin might affect penetration depth
	- spectroscopic measurements of dissolved sugar in blood -> can use to determine absorption wavelength
	- spectroscopic measurements -> can measure/change recorded depth
	- not much reason to use for glucose
	- single photon diodes faster
- Hyper spectral benefits:
	- Gets a wide range of wavelengths
	- Cheap
